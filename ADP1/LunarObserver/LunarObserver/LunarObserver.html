    <h1>Lunar Observer</h1>
    
    <p>Many astronomy organizations provide observation programs. These programs are designed to educate astronomers
    about the night sky, while providing a structured regiment to attain an observation goal.</P>
    
    <p>The lunar observation program is a great way for beginning astronomers to educate themselves about our nearest
    neighbor, while learning the phases of the moon at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>Lunar Observer is a tool for astronomers to maintain an organized approach while completing a basic lunar observation
    program. This particular program requires observation of 100 lunar features, many of which can be completed by naked eye
    observation alone.</P>
    
    <p>Completing the lunar program is a great way for astronomers to continue observing when the moon is up,
    illuminating the night sky. This program can be completed with very modest equipment, even from the most light polluted
    skies.</p>
    
    <p>Lunar Observer includes 100 features for the astronomer to observe. This list represents the most common group of features
    for level one lunar programs.</p>
    
    <p>These features are organized by equipment required, beginning with naked eye features, then binocular features, and finally
    telescope features. These features can be observed with the equipment specified, but you may move up to the next level of equipment
    if seeing or eyesight prevents you from observing at that level.</p>
    
    <p>The items in the table are color coded based on whether they have been observed, to provide a quick way to determine
    which features remain to complete the program. Each feature can be toggled to the observed state by clicking the "Mark Observed"
    button.</p>
